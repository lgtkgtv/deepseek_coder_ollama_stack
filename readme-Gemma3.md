# How to run Ollama directly via Docker?

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop:** Make sure your system is up-to-date.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
2.  **Docker and Docker Compose:** If you haven't already, install them:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose git
    sudo systemctl enable docker --now # Enable and start Docker service
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER    # Add your user to the docker group
    ```
    **Important:** After adding your user to the `docker` group, you **must log out and log back in** (or restart your computer) for the changes to take effect. Do this before proceeding.

### Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File

We'll use Docker Compose to define and run both the Ollama server and the Open WebUI.

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/ollama-webui-cpu-docker-based
    cd ~/ollama-webui-cpu-docker-based
    ```

2.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`:** Open a text editor (like `nano` or `gedit`) and create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in this directory:

    ```bash
    gedit docker-compose.yml
    ```

3.  **Paste the following content into the file:**

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      ollama:
        image: ollama/ollama:latest
        container_name: ollama
        # No --gpus=all here as you don't have a GPU
        ports:
          - "11434:11434" # Ollama API port
        volumes:
          - ollama_models:/root/.ollama # Persistent storage for models
        restart: unless-stopped
        # Environment variables for CPU optimization (optional, can be added if you face issues)
        # environment:
        #   - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
        #   - OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 # Limit parallel requests for CPU
        #   - OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1 # Limit loaded models for CPU

      open-webui:
        image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
        container_name: open-webui
        ports:
          - "3000:8080" # WebUI access port (Host:3000 -> Container:8080)
        volumes:
          - open-webui_data:/app/backend/data # Persistent storage for WebUI data (chat history, users)
        depends_on:
          - ollama # Ensures Ollama starts before Open WebUI
        environment:
          # Optional: Set a secret key for Open WebUI for added security (replace with a strong, random string)
          # - WEBUI_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_here
          - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434 # Point to the Ollama service within the Docker network
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      ollama_models:
      open-webui_data:
    ```

4.  **Save the file:** If using `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm save, then `Enter`.

-----

### Step 2: Start the Services

1.  **Navigate to your project directory (if you're not already there):**

    ```bash
    cd ~/ollama-webui-cpu-docker-based
    ```

2.  **Start the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

      * This command will:
          * Download the `ollama/ollama:latest` and 
                         `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama` Docker images (this might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed).
          * Create and start the `ollama` container.
          * Create and start the `open-webui` container, linked to the `ollama` container.

3.  **Verify that the containers are running:**

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see both `ollama` and `open-webui` listed as running.

4.  **Allow traffic on port 3000 (if you have a firewall like UFW enabled):**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
    ```

-----

### Step 3: Access Open WebUI and Run Gemma 3

1.  **Open your web browser:** Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2.  **Create an account:** The first time you access Open WebUI, you'll be prompted to create a user account. This account is local to your Open WebUI instance.
3.  **Pull the Gemma 3 model:**
      * Once logged in, look for the **"Select a model"** dropdown menu, typically in the top-left or sidebar.
      * Click on it, and then usually, you'll find a search bar or a list of models.
      * Type `gemma3` into the search bar.
      * You will see various Gemma 3 models available (e.g., `gemma3:latest`, `gemma3:1b`, `gemma3:4b`, `gemma3:12b`, `gemma3:27b`, and optimized `gemma3n` versions).
      * **Recommendation for CPU-only:** Given you don't have a GPU, start with a smaller, highly quantized version. `gemma3:1b` or `gemma3:4b` are good choices. The larger the model, the more RAM it requires and the slower it will be on your CPU.
      * Click the **"Pull"** button (or download icon) next to the model you choose. Open WebUI will show the download progress.
4.  **Start Chatting:**
      * Once the model download is complete, it should be automatically selected.
      * Type your prompt into the chat input box at the bottom and press Enter to start interacting with Gemma 3.

-----

**To stop and remove the containers (and optionally delete models):**

1.  **Stop the services:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/ollama-webui-cpu
    docker compose down
    ```
2.  **To also remove the downloaded models and Open WebUI data (use with caution, this deletes your chat history\!):**
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v
    ```

This Docker Compose setup provides a robust and easy-to-manage environment for running Ollama and Open WebUI on your Ubuntu desktop without a GPU. 

Enjoy experimenting with Gemma 3\!

# Prompt-1 
Write hello-world in Rust

## response

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`fn main() { ... }`**: This defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the Rust program. Every Rust program must have a `main` function.
* **`println!("Hello, world!");`**:  This line prints the text "Hello, world!" to the console.
    * `println!` is a macro that prints output to the console.  It's often used for more readable output than `print`.
    * `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal containing the text to be printed.

**How to compile and run the code:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the code above in a file named `main.rs`.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `main.rs`. Then, compile the code using the Rust compiler:
   ```bash
   rustc main.rs
   ```
   This will create an executable file named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows).

3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program:
   * **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     ./main
     ```
   * **Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\main.exe
     ```

   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

**Using Cargo (the Rust package manager):**

Cargo is the standard tool for Rust development. It simplifies the process of building, running, and managing Rust projects.

1. **Create a new project:**  Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cargo new hello_world
   cd hello_world
   ```
   This creates a new directory called `hello_world` containing the basic structure for your project.

2. **Replace the contents of `src/main.rs`:**  The `src/main.rs` file will already contain the basic `main` function. However, you can modify this file directly to include the `println!` statement.

3. **Compile and run:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
   Cargo will compile and run the program, and you'll see the output:
   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

**Why use Cargo?**

* **Dependency Management:** Cargo makes it easy to manage dependencies (external libraries) for your project.
* **Build Automation:** It handles the compilation process for you.
* **Project Structure:**  It provides a standardized project structure that helps you organize your code.
* **Testing:** It integrates with a testing framework, making it easy to write and run tests.

The best practice is to always use Cargo for Rust development, even for small projects.  It's the way Rust is typically used in real-world development.
