To focus on security-related vulnerabilities, you can prioritize probes that target areas like malware, evasion, injections, and system integrity. Here are some of the most relevant probes for security:

1. **malwaregen**
   - **malwaregen.Evasion**: Targets malware evasion techniques, identifying if a system can bypass detection.
   - **malwaregen.Payload**: Checks for payload delivery methods often used in malicious attacks.
   - **malwaregen.TopLevel**: Assesses the top-level capabilities and execution methods for malware.
   - **malwaregen.SubFunctions**: Focuses on the smaller, often overlooked components of malware.

2. **latentinjection**
   - **latentinjection.LatentInjectionJailbreak**: Explores latent injection vulnerabilities related to jailbreaking systems.
   - **latentinjection.LatentInjectionFactSnippet**: Tests for latent injections within factual data snippets that could be malicious.
   - **latentinjection.LatentInjectionTranslation**: Explores injection issues through multilingual data.

3. **xss (Cross-Site Scripting)**
   - **xss.ColabAIDataLeakage**: Investigates the leakage of data through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
   - **xss.MarkdownImageExfil**: Focuses on the exfiltration of data using XSS and Markdown image tags.
   - **xss.MdExfil20230929**: Targets XSS exfiltration techniques via markdown.
   - **xss.StringAssemblyDataExfil**: Checks for data exfiltration through string assembly in XSS attacks.

4. **encoding**
   - **encoding.InjectBase64**: Focuses on Base64 encoding vulnerabilities, which are often used for obfuscation or hiding malicious payloads.
   - **encoding.InjectROT13**: Assesses the use of ROT13 encoding in obfuscating malicious data.
   - **encoding.InjectHex**: Looks for hexadecimal encoding issues, which can be used to hide attack vectors.

5. **promptinject**
   - **promptinject.HijackHateHumans**: Tests for hijacking prompt injections aimed at triggering malicious behaviors.
   - **promptinject.HijackKillHumans**: Investigates attempts to inject prompts that encourage dangerous or harmful actions.
   - **promptinject.HijackLongPrompt**: Checks for long-form prompt injections that might evade detection.

6. **fileformats**
   - **fileformats.HF_Files**: Focuses on vulnerabilities related to specific file formats, which can often be exploited for system compromise.

By prioritizing probes in these categories, you can focus on security vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that could be exploited by malicious actors.
