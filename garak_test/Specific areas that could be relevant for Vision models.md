The Garak LLM vulnerability scanner primarily focuses on probing for vulnerabilities related to language models, data encoding, and various forms of adversarial input, rather than on specific vision models or frameworks like OpenVINO or Google's VIT-base model. However, while the scanner might not directly target vision models, some of its probes could potentially be relevant to AI models in general, including vision models, especially in terms of:

1. **Prompt Injection** – Even though this is typically used with text-based models, a similar concept of injecting malicious or adversarial prompts could be explored for vision models if the model is prompted with text or processed input data (e.g., image captions or text descriptions for models like VIT).
   
2. **Malware and Evasion** – Malwaregen's **evasion** probes may indirectly be useful if attackers attempt to evade vision models by feeding in adversarial inputs or images that are specifically designed to mislead the model.

3. **Encoding** – The **encoding** probes, like those checking for base64 or other encoding schemes, could be useful if an attacker uses encoded images or image URLs as part of their attack vector. For example, images might be encoded into a format to avoid detection by security filters.

While Garak doesn't seem to have dedicated probes for vision models or frameworks like OpenVINO or VIT-base, **cross-site scripting (XSS)** and **data exfiltration** probes, for example, could be extended to visual content if the system involves embedding images within web interfaces or processing image data over the internet.

### Specific areas that could be relevant for Vision models:
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Probes or generators that simulate attacks against the model by altering visual inputs to produce incorrect outputs.
- **Data Exfiltration (e.g., XSS or Encoding-related probes)**: Could be relevant if the vision model is exposed through a web interface and attackers seek to extract information by exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Injection Attacks**: For systems integrating vision and language (e.g., VIT-base with text input), prompt injection or latent injections could be relevant for vision models as well.

Currently, Garak doesn't have dedicated probes for image-based attacks or for evaluating the security of vision models, but these general concepts might apply indirectly. If you need more specific probes for vision model security, you might want to explore tools or frameworks specifically designed for evaluating adversarial machine learning in computer vision models.
